# HTML Semantic Content Foundations

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of clean HTML structure and semantic content hierarchy to present information in a readable, maintainable, and standards-compliant way.

Although minimal in scope, the goal of this project is to reinforce correct usage of heading levels, content grouping, and semantic clarity—foundational principles that apply to all frontend and full-stack applications.

This project was built as part of **#90DaysOfCode**, focusing on correctness and structure rather than visual styling.

## Why This Matters

Well-structured HTML is critical for:

- Scalable frontend and full-stack systems

Even backend-heavy systems rely on correct frontend foundations. This project reflects an intentional focus on getting those fundamentals right.
